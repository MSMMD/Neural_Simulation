  abstract  = "We consider a new class of non Markovian processes with a
               countable number of interacting components. At each time unit,
               each component can take two values, indicating if it has a spike
               or not at this precise moment. The system evolves as follows. For
               each component, the probability of having a spike at the next
               time unit depends on the entire time evolution of the system
               after the last spike time of the component. This class of systems
               extends in a non trivial way both the interacting particle
               systems, which are Markovian (Spitzer in Adv. Math. 5:246--290,
               1970) and the stochastic chains with memory of variable length
               which have finite state space (Rissanen in IEEE Trans. Inf.
               Theory 29(5):656--664, 1983). These features make it suitable to
               describe the time evolution of biological neural systems. We
               construct a stationary version of the process by using a
               probabilistic tool which is a Kalikow-type decomposition either
               in random environment or in space-time. This construction implies
               uniqueness of the stationary process. Finally we consider the
               case where the interactions between components are given by a
               critical directed Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi-type random graph with a
               large but finite number of components. In this framework we
               obtain an explicit upper-bound for the correlation between
               successive inter-spike intervals which is compatible with
               previous empirical findings.",
